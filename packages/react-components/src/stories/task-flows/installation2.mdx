# Compare Data

comparison differences analysis

## Intent
Enables users to scan and compare multiple complex entities with similar information categories to support decision making based on the differences.  

Comparison may be between just two entities requiring a dedicated focus on differences in values, shown visually or numerically. Comparison may also be between multiple attributes — requiring a soft highlight on all differences and other visual representations.

### Guidelines for adapting the Task Flow
* Consider whether the users would want to compare 2 sets of attributes or more than 2 sets.
  * When comparing 2 sets of attributes, you can represent the differences between the sets as a subtraction between values or showing side by side values. These deltas can also be represented as a plot.
  * When comparing more than 2 sets of attributes, you can consider displaying values of each set as columns in a table. Also consider visualizations to aid in comparison.
* Data visualizations like graphs and charts can help to highlight the differences and similarities between sets being compared.
* Prioritize the attributes which are critical for comparison instead of exposing all of the attributes in a single view.
* If there are too many attributes to compare, allow users to prioritize comparisons by providing ways to search & filter the attributes. This makes it easier for them to focus on their interests instead of getting overwhelmed by a large comparison matrix.
* Consider offering an expanded view of a selected set or attribute to view additional related details, data tables, or diagrams. The expanded view could be displayed in a pop-up or a vertical or horizontal slide out panel.
* Consider providing the ability to save or export comparison results.
