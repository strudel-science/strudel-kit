# Design System Working Group

Design System maintainers are responsible for developing and sustaining the [STRUDEL Design System](https://strudel.science/design-system/overview/), including STRUDEL-Kit. They must:  
- Keep the STRUDEL Design System usable by the community. This includes stewardship of the STRUDEL Kit, Task Flow designs, tutorials, and documentation.  
- Monitor issues, emails, and pull requests, even if they are not the primary contact point for a given issue, email, or pull request  
- Ensure a maintainer replies to new issues, emails, and pull requests promptly, ideally within two days  
- Ensure other contributors have adequate opportunity to engage  
- Define and maintaining a product roadmap
